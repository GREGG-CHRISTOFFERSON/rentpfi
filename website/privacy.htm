        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            PFI Incorporated takes seriously the privacy of those that visit our web site. We have established this Privacy Policy to communicate what information
            we collect and how that information is used and safeguarded.</p>
        <p>
            By accessing this website ({{globals.site.host}}), you acknowledge the terms and conditions expressed herein. We reserve the right to change this policy
            at our sole discretion and without notice.</p>
        <h3>
        What information is collected, and why?</h3>
        <p>
            When a user visits our website, we collect information about the visit that does not identify the user personally. We track information such as the domain
            from which the user is visiting and the user's browser type. We also collect specific information regarding the user's session on our website.
            This includes items such as the date and time of the visit and the pages viewed.</p>
        <p>
            Sometimes we ask a user to voluntarily provide personally identifiable information (PII). This information generally includes, but is not limited to, name,
            e-mail address, postal address, and telephone number. We request this information when the user requests one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To register to attend an on-line seminar or demonstration</li>
            <li>To receive specific information from us such as a whitepaper or code sample</li>
            <li>To sign up for a mailing list</li>
            <li>To correspond with us</li>
            <li>Or any other such activity that we deem necessary</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            PFI Incorporated does not collect any personally identifiable financial or health-related information. We do not intentionally collect information from
            children under the age of 13.</p>
        <h3>
        How is the information used?</h3>
        <p>
            Non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) is collected to allow us to analyze how our website is used and to improve the content and service the
            website provides.</p>
        <p>
            Personally identifiable information is collected for analysis to improve the content of the website and the services we provide the user.</p>
        <p>
            PFI Incorporated owns the collected information and will not sell, trade, or rent the information to others. We may use the information to continue contact
            with the user. This may include contact such as follow-up calls, e-mail correspondence, or mail correspondence to follow-up on the contact
            or to provide marketing information about promotions, new services, or important website changes. PFI Incorporated may share this information
            with its business partners for the specific purpose of a promotion or service offering.</p>
        <h3>
        Are "Cookies" used on the website?</h3>
        <p>
            "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are placed on a web user's hard drive. We may use cookies to provide you with better service. Cookies are
            pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful
            by storing information about your preferences for a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major Web sites use
            them to provide useful features for their customers. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify
            a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, you
            may not be able to take full advantage of the functionality of the PFI Incorporated site if you do so.</p>
        <h3>
        How is personally identifiable information safeguarded?</h3>
        <p>
            PFI Incorporated utilizes industry standard methods and mechanisms such as firewalls, intrusion monitoring, and passwords to protect electronic information.
            Multiple physical security methods such as locking devices and 24 hour premise monitoring are also employed. Finally, access to PII is limited
            to a small number of personnel and on a need-to-know basis.</p>
        <h3>
        Links to other web sites</h3>
        <p>
            PFI Incorporated web site may contain links to other internet web sites. PFI Incorporated neither controls nor endorses external sites and is not responsible
            for the content of such sites. This policy does not cover the privacy policies and data collection practices of non-PFI Incorporated web sites.</p>
        <h3>
        How to opt out of correspondence</h3>
        <p>
            Based on the information a user has provided, PFI Incorporated may send e-mail correspondence to the user. Each correspondence will contain an easy means
            to opt out of further correspondence.</p>
